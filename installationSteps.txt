Important Message about React Navigation v5
---------------------------------------------------

This project will be using the v4 version of React Navigation and not 
the v5 version. To date, this code still works as expected. The v4 version 
is still important to know and understand as it is used widely in existing codebases in many organizations. 
I highly encourage you to continue on with the course as it is so that you fully understand how React Navigation works. 
Once you have finished the course, you can use this as a self-study opportunity to attempt a migration of your 
finished working projects to v5. The docs provide some great resources on this: 
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/upgrading-from-4.x/. 


8. npm install @rneui/themed @rneui/base(react-native-elements)

9. navigationOptions Deprecation Warning

      return {
        headerShown: false,
      };

Async Storage Update
